## What is Castling Finance?

> Castling is a move in chess that defends the king and activates the rook.

Castling Finance is an active liquidity management protocol that deploys strategies to maximise returns for providing liquidity in the decentralised markets.

#### Problems with passive liquidity positions

Traditionally, passively providing liquidity on-chain suffered from these key problems:

1. First generation AMMs like UniswapV2 and Curve provide liquidity across the price range. This makes them capital inefficient and significantly increases the risk of impermanent loss.
2. Second generation AMMs like UniswapV3, provide discretion and thus improve on capital efficiency. However, they require liquidity providers to constantly seek optimised configuration for their liquidity positions.&#x20;
3. The onset of multi-chain paradigm along with continued innovations in decentralised markets has increasingly fragmented market volumes to multiple trading venues across layer 1 and layer 2 chains.
4. Highly sophisticated market participants deploy high frequency strategies that 'chip-away' LP fees and put passive liquidity providers at an asymmetric disadvantage.
5. Empirical research has shown that liquidity providers who use on-chain and off-chain data along with financial modelling techniques significantly improve their risk-to-reward ratio for providing liquidity.

#### How Castling actively manages liquidity?

Castling creates active strategy vaults where liquidity providers can deposit their tokens and get LP tokens in return. These vaults work as follows:

1. Castling vaults use whitelisted as well as proprietary liquidity management strategies for liquidity providers. The strategy overview for each vault along with back tests and stress tests is published when strategies open for deposit.
2. Castling LP tokens are fungible, transferable and support full as well as partial redemption.
3. The profits from each strategy are reinvested during rebalancing for continuous compounding.
4. All the strategy vault addresses are publicly available.
5. Chat support as well as onboarding assistance is provided to all liquidity providers irrespective of deposit size.
